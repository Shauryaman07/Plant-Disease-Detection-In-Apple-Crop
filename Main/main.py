    #### About the Dataset
    This application is designed to recognize diseases in apple plants. 
    The dataset comprises images of apple leaves categorized into three classes:
    - **Healthy**
    - **Rust**
    - **Scab**
    
    The model has been trained using TensorFlow and Keras to provide accurate predictions.

    ### Leaf Conditions:
    - **Healthy Leaves**: These leaves are vibrant green and firm, indicating that the plant is receiving proper nutrients and water. They are free from spots, discoloration, or wilting.
    
    - **Rust Leaves**: Leaves affected by rust disease may show orange or reddish-brown spots on the upper side, with a powdery substance on the underside. This fungal infection can weaken the plant and reduce yield if not managed promptly.
    
    - **Scab Leaves**: Apple scab typically presents as dark, olive-green spots on the upper leaf surface. As the disease progresses, these spots can turn brown and cause the leaves to curl and drop prematurely, affecting the overall health of the tree.
